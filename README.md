# Fun Calculator

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator** â€” a simple and enjoyable Python program to perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers! ðŸ˜ŽðŸŽ‰

## Features

- Adds two numbers (supports decimals)
- Subtracts the second number from the first
- Multiplies two numbers
- Divides the first number by the second  
- Friendly and fun interactive user experience

## How to Use

1. Run the script.
2. When prompted, enter the first number (decimals allowed).
3. Enter the second number (decimals allowed).
4. Receive the results for:
   - Sum
   - Difference
   - Product
   - Quotient

## Notes

- The program uses `float()` to accept decimal numbers.
- It does **not** currently handle division by zero, so please ensure the second number is not zero.
- Designed for educational fun and easy arithmetic operations.

## Example

```
Enter the first number: 10.5
Enter the second number: 2
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.5
Difference: 8.5
Product: 21.0
Quotient: 5.25
```

## Future Improvements

- Add error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero.
- Support for more operations like modulo, exponentiation.
- A nicer GUI or web interface.
